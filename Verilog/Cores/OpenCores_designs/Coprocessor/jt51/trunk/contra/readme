Contra / Double Dragon Sound Boards
-----------------------------------


This set of files show how to connect the JT51 to a m6809 processor, RAM
memory and ROM memory in order to get sound from two different arcade
video games: Contra and Double Dragon.

The files are incomplete as the original video game ROM memories are not
included. The m6809 core is not included but it can be obtained from
opencores.org. Other minor files, like UART and DAC modules are not included
either. The only purpose is to show connectivity in a real scenario and for
that visual inspection of these files should be sufficient.
