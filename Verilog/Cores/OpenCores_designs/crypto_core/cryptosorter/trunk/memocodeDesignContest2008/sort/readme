Description about the files under the sort folder that are used in generating the design for the memocode design contest 2008.

BRAMLevel2Merger.bsv: Instantiate the 2nd level of the sort tree
BRAMLevel3Merger.bsv: Instantiate the 3rd level of the sort tree
BRAMLevel4Merger.bsv: Instantiate the 4th level of the sort tree
BRAMLevel5Merger.bsv: Instantiate the 5th level of the sort tree
BRAMLevel6Merger.bsv: Instantiate the 6th level of the sort tree
BRAMLevelFIFOAdders/BRAMVLevelFIFO.bsv: Implement the VLevelFIFO interface by time multiplexing a BRAM between multiple logical fifos.
BRAM_v/BRAM.bsv: wrap BRAM verilog into Bluespec 
BRAM_v/BRAMFIFO.bsv: wrap BRAMFIFO verilog into Bluespec
BRAM_v/BRAMFIFOF.v: BRAMFIFO verilog implementation
BRAM_v/UGBRAM.v: BRAM verilog implementation
EHRReg.bsv: A library component that implements EHRReg
Level1Merger.bsv: Instantiate the 1st level of the sort tree
Makefile: Makefile
Sort.bsv: A generic implementation of each level of a sort tree.
SortTree64.bsv: Instantiate the whole 6 levels sort tree
VLevelFIFO.bsv: Define the interface of a vector of logical fifos implemented by a BRAM.
