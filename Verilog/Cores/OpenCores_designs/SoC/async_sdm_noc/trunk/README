Asynchronous Spatial Division Multiplexing Router for On-Chip Networks

Version: 0.2 

On-chip networks or networks-on-chip (NoCs) are the on-chip communication fabric for
current and future multiprocessor SoCs (MPSoCs) and chip multiprocessors (CMPs).
Compared with synchronous NoCs, asynchronous NoCs have following benefits:
  * Tolerance to all kinds of delay variations caused by process, power and temperature
    variations.
  * Low transmission latency.
  * Zero dynamic power when idle.
  * Unified sync/async interface and easy clock domain integration.

Most NoCs use the wormhole flow control method. Many complex flow control methods are
built upon the wormhole method, such as virtual channel (VC), TDMA, and SDM. VC is the
most utilized flow control in both sync and async NoCs. However, it is found VC
compromises the throughput performance of asynchronous NoCs. This project provides a new
asynchronous router structure which use SDM rather than VC. It has been shown that SDM
achieve better throughput than VC in the same router configuration.

This project provide a reconfigurable asynchronous SDM router which can be configured
into a basic wormhole router or an SDM router with multiple virtual circuits in every
direction.    

Features:
  * 5-port router for mesh network (0 south, 1 west, 2 north, 3 east, 4 local)
  * The dimension order routing (XY routing)
  * Available flow control methods: wormhole, SDM, VC
  * Reconfigurable number of virtual circuits, buffer size, data width
  * Fully synthesizable router implementation
  * SystemC testbench provided

Languages:
  * Routers are written in synthesizable SystemVerilog
  * Test benches are provided by SystemC 

Software requirements:
  * The open source Nangate 45nm cell library
  * Synopsys Design Compiler (Synthesis)
  * Cadence IUS -- NC Simulator (for SystemC/Verilog co-simulation)

How to run:
  * to synthesize a router
    1. set up your design compiler enviornment and your cell library.
    2. modify the "define.v" configuration file for the strcture your want.
       currently including:
         ENABLE_CLOS   use the 2-stage Clos switch instead of crossbar
         ENABLE_CRRD   use the CRRD dispatching algorithm for the Clos
         ENABLE_MRMA   use the multi-resource matching arbiter instead of MNMA
         ENABLE_CHANNEL_SLICING  use channel slicing
         ENABLE_LOOKAHEAD  use the lookahead pipelines
         ENABLE_EOF    router use eof bit to indicate end-of-frame
    3. modify the "compile.tcl" scription for the design parameters.
       currently including: 
         VCN   number of virtual circuits
         DW    the data width of a single virtual circuit
         IPD   the depth of input buffers
         OPD   the depth of putput buffers
    4. if another cell lib is used, change "cell_lib.v" in common\src and other related
       files. (very likely you need to email me for further instructions :-) )
    5. modify the "tech.tcl" in common/script for your cell library.
    6. run the synthesis at [sdm/vc]/syn
       dc_shell -f script/compile.tcl
    7. the synthesized netlist is inside [sdm/vc]/syn/file/

  * to run post-synthesis simulation
    1. check the netlists in [sdm/vc]/syn/file/
    2. modify the testbench configuration "define.h" according to your requirements.
       Especially make sure the following are matched (at least in the SDM routers):
         ChBW = DW/8; SubChN = VCN
    3. make sure your NC-Simulator is installed alright (proper SystemC support).
    4. run the compilation at [sdm/vc]/sim
       compile.sh
    5. run the simulation at [sdm/vc]/sim
       ncsim -tcl noctb
    6. the simulation output files are *.ana at [sdm/vc]/sim
       "throughput.ana":
         {simulation time in ps} TAB {throughput in bytes}
       "delay.ana":
         {simulation time in ps} TAB {avg. frame latency} TAB {avg. path setup delay}

  * The process of synthesize and simulate the VC router is similar to the procedure of
    the wormhole/SDM router.

=================================================
Known issues:
* 28/05/2012     reported by Zhou, Peiyuan
    The Nangate_typ.db in ./lib/ is precompiled using DC_vC2009.06-SP2.
    If lower versions of DC is used to synthesize the project, DC may fail to load 
  this cell library and request a higher version.
    In this case, you need to recompile the Nangate Cell library from the original
  Liberty cell library provided in the Nangate 45nm open cell library PDK. There are
  three lib formats provided in the Nangate library: ccs, ecsm and nldm. The ccs and 
  ecsm formats provide more accurate delay infomation than nldm, so please use those
  two whenever possible. For asynchronous circuits, the typical corner is used in 
  most cases.
    If you do not know how to compile a libarty library in DC, read the man page for
  commands "read_lib" and "write_lib" in DC.
