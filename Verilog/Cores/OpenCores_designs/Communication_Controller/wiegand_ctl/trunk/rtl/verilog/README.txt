This TTP/C Controller was designed according to the SAE AS6003 standard. 
Because of the licensing issue it can not be published on the Opencores web site.  
Go to www.sae.org to download the standard.

The TTP/C Controller was also implemented in real HW (several boards
were constantly talking to each other).

The included test bench is not a real test bench and should be improved.
However a volunteer is needed for such a job. I can provide some help
but am not willing to write it by myself.

Best regards,
  Jeff Anderson
