This Xilinx Base System (created with 12.2) includes the SATA2 Core with
 interfaces to PLB for command, control and status and to DDR through 
NPI for data. A C test program which runs on Microblaze to exercise the core 
is under "sata_test".

Note: Use Makefiles under the respective coregen directories of the SATA
and NPI cores to generate netlists for FIFOs and ILAs. Then copy or link
these to the netlist directories.
