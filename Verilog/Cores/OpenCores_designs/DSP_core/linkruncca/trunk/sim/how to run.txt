This simulation uses Verilator tool.
Please refer to http://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing for installation.

Simulation only works on <.pgm> image format.
It reads an PGM input image and outputs a bounding boxes image "box_out.pgm".

Simulation can be initiated by running simulation script in terminal window:
	sh CCA.sh

Test image can be specified in the "CCA.sh" script:
	img="testimage/4283.pgm"
