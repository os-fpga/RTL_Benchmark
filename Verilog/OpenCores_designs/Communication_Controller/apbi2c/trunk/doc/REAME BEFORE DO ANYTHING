Before you begin working with our block is recommended to read the specification which is within the same directory. Our proposal is to create an IP that can go into the silicon. Because it is an IP that many manufacturers have several versions the group decided to make it public. 

We are still working on it but we consider very important the feedback information about the use of the same FPGAs or another devices. 

The RX block is still under construction and TX still needs to be properly adjusted and tested as well as the FIFO.



ESTIMATED PRIMITIVES USED 

APB: 115 primitives
FIFO: 620 primitives
i2c: 800 primitives 

WHAT WE WISH TO DO:

-- Test bench o verilog to test DUT
-- Refine Documentation
-- Include more Features on I2C if possible
-- Make a a verification spec to I2C
-- Design a model using system verilog/ systemC
-- Better comments
