There are two versions of IrDA core:
The full one (with up to 4Mbit speed) and the reduced one 
(with only up to 115.2Kbit (SIR) UART-based mode).
The reduced one has another top-level file: irda_top_sir_only.v

Note that at current stage the full one is surely full of bugs.
The reduced one is hopefully working since it is much simpler and is
based on the well-tested uart16550 core with only some wrapping 
around it.
