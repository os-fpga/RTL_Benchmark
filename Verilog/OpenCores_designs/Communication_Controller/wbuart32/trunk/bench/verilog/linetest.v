// Filename: 	linetest.v
//
// Project:	wbuart32, a full featured UART with simulator
//
// Purpose:	To test that the txuart and rxuart modules work properly, by
//		buffering one line's worth of input, and then piping that line
//	to the transmitter while (possibly) receiving a new line.
//
//	With some modifications (discussed below), this RTL should be able to
//	run as a top-level testing file, requiring only the transmit and receive
//	UART pins and the clock to work.

// One issue with the design is how to set the values of the setup register.
// (*This is a comment, not a verilator attribute ... )  Verilator needs to
// know/set those values in order to work.  However, this design can also be
// used as a stand-alone top level configuration file.  In this latter case,
// the setup register needs to be set internal to the file.  Here, we use
// OPT_STANDALONE to distinguish between the two.  If set, the file runs under
// (* Another comment still ...) Verilator and we need to get i_setup from the
// external environment.  If not, it must be set internally.
