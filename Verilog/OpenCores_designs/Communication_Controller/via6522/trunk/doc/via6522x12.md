### PB (Reg 00)
Operates in the same manner as the 6522 port B but is 12-bits wide rather than 8-bits. If port B input latching is enabled, then input data on port B is latched by an active transition of the selected handshaking signal. Otherwise input data is reflected directly by reading the port register.
### PA (Reg 01)
Operates in the same manner as the 6522 port A but is 12-bits wide rather than 8-bits. If port A input latching is enabled, then input data on port A is latched by an active transition of the selected handshaking signal. Otherwise input data is reflected directly by reading the port register.
### PBDDR (Reg 02)
Operates in the same manner as the 6522 port B ddr but is 12-bits wide rather than 8-bits. Each bit that is set in this register set the corresponding port B I/O to an output. Each bit that is clear in this register sets the port B I/O to an input. The default value in this register at reset is zero, making all port B I/O’s inputs.
### PADDR (Reg 03)
Operates in the same manner as the 6522 port A ddr but is 12-bits wide rather than 8-bits. Each bit that is set in this register set the corresponding port A I/O to an output. Each bit that is clear in this register sets the port A I/O to an input. The default value in this register at reset is zero, making all port A I/O’s inputs.
### T1CL (Reg 04)
Similar function to the reg 4 of the 6522. Provides read access to the low order 12-bits of timer 1. Acts as a latch for the low 12-bits of the value to be loaded into the timer. 
### T1CH (Reg 05)
Similar in function to register 5 of the 6522. When the timer is in 24-bit mode writing this register transfers bit 0 to 11 of the timer 1 latch to bits 0 to 11 of the timer and transfers input data bits 0 to 11 to counter bits 12 to 23 of the timer.
### T1LL (Reg 06)
Similar in function to register 6 of the 6522. Provides access to the timer 1 low order latches.
### T1LH (Reg 07)
Similar in function to register 7 of the 6522. Provides access to the timer 1 high order latches.
### T2CL (Reg 08)
Similar in function to register 8 of the 6522. Provides access to timer 2 low order latch / count.
### T2CH (Reg 09)
Similar in function to register 9 of the 6522. Provides access to timer 2 high order latch / count.
### SR (Reg 10)
Similar in function to register 10 of the 6522. The shift register is 12-bits wide.

### PA (Reg 15)
This is an alias to access port A except no handshaking is present.
### T3CL (Reg 16)
Provides read access to the low order 12-bits of timer 3. Acts as a latch for the low 12-bits of the value to be loaded into the timer. 
### T3CH (Reg 17)
Writing this register transfers bit 0 to 11 of the timer 3 latch to bits 0 to 11 of the timer and transfers input data bits 0 to 11 to counter bits 12 to 23 of the timer.
### T3LL (Reg 18)
Provides access to the timer 1 low order latches.
### T3LH (Reg 19)
Provides access to the timer 3 high order latches.
### T3CMPL (Reg 20)
Contains the low order 12 bits of a comparison value that will cause an interrupt flag to be set if timer #3 exceeds this value.
### T3CMPH (Reg 21)
Contains the high order 12 bits of the comparison value.

## Key Differences from a 6522
The reset input (rst_i) is active high.
The IRQ output (irq_o) is not open collector and is active high.
There is only a single active high circuit select (cs_i).

## Software Examples
The via6522x12 is being used for timing and gpio in a 12-bit 6809 test system.
