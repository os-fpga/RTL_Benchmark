# NLPRG

This project provides an example of a non-linear pseudo random generator ( nlprg ). The nlprg can produce a pseudo-random sequence with a period of 2^n numbers, where n is the numbers of registers. 
For more information an circuit examples visit my blog at https://fdblog.xyz/circuits/non-linear-pseudo-random-generator-introduction/

The nlprg implementations in this repository range from 3 to 16 bits. 

In the rtl folder you will find all the rtl nlprg implementations, in the tb folder you will find all the testbenches, in the doc folder there are all the circuit shematics and in the dig folders all the dig files used to generate the rtl.
The tool used is Digital by Hneemann, you can find it at this link https://github.com/hneemann/Digital.

The simulation stores the generated sequence in the tb/log and the waveforms in tb/wave.
