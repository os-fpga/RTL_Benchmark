Example showing the full set of template options (myagent.tpl and common.tpl), but an absolute minimum of user-defined code.

The templates have settings to pull in every optional include file. The empty include files themselves are in the inc directory.

The agent (myagent) uses a register model so that the corresponding settings can be demonstrated

The dummy DUT has no ports, so there are no pin mappings in the dut_pfile
