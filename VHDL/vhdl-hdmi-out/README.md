# vhdl-hdmi-out

HDMI Out driver written in VHDL for 7-Series Xilinx FPGAs. Only video side is 
implemented and audio stuff is not included. Three resolutions are added. 
Serial cock runs at 5x the pixel clock and uses `OSERDES` blocks to generate 
the TMDS signals. Can be used to connect to a DVI input as well since they 
share the same protocol and timings. A `SERIES6` generic is added to replace 
`OSERDES2` blocks with `OSERDES1` blocks that are used in 6-Series. Since 
`OSERDES1` is not encrypted, GHDL can also elaborate and simulate the 
behavior.

Project is configured to run at `125 Mhz` clock, but can be configurable from 
the [clock_gen.vhd](rtl/clock_gen.vhd) to run at different frequencies. 
[timing_generator.vhd](rtl/timing_generator.vhd) generates the the video timing 
signals: *hsync*, *vsync*, *video_active* as well as the pixel x and 
y locations. [pattern_generator.vhd](rtl/pattern_generator.vhd) and 
[objectbuffer.vhd](rtl/objectbuffer.vhd) are used to generate RGB pixel values 
and [rgb2tmds.vhd](rtl/rgb2tmds.vhd) is the top module that handles the 
conversion from RGB values to TMDS signal outputs.

[GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/) can be used to simulate the circuit, and 
[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) can be used to display the waveform. 
[makefile](makefile) is given to automate elaboration steps. It needs *Xilinx 
Vivado* installation to compile Xilinx supplied primitives such as `BUFG`, 
`OBUFDS` and `PLLE2`. However, `OSERDES2` that is used in the project is 
encrypted and cannot be imported to GHDL, so a generic is added to replace it 
with `OSERDES1` that is used in 6-Series devices. It is enabled by default in 
the simulation, and should be disabled if `OSERDES2` blocks are to be used. 
Update the relevant line with your Xilinx Vivado installation. (or run with 
`XILINX_VIVADO` environmental variable instead)

## Features

* Supports `720p (1280x720)`, `SVGA (800x600)`, and `VGA (640x480)` modes.
* Two patterns are included that are selectable on synthesizing
    * a rainbow color pattern - shows color spectrum
    * an object buffer for a game base - generates a wall, a box, and a ball. 
      Wall is the stationary object, and box / ball are movable objects using 
      the position signals. Background color can also be changed from top level
* Tested on `Arty-Z7-20`, `Pynq-Z1` and `Pynq-Z2` boards.

## Misc.

* There is an on/off problem on `Pynq-Z2` board when the clock is sourced from 
  125 Mhz PL clock. The display turns on for ~1 seconds and off for ~1 second. 
  This problem goes away when the clock is generated from ZYNQ IO PLL.
    * [Yuri Cauwerts](https://github.com/zyuri) kindly pointed out that 
      connecting Ethernet cable fixes the problem.
* [tmds_encoder](rtl/tmds_encoder.vhd) usually needs pipelining for fixing 
  timing problems. Usually I leave this to students to figure out how to 
  implement it.
* [vhdl-display-simulator](https://github.com/fcayci/vhdl-display-simulator) 
  can be used to see the screen output without implementing your designs.
