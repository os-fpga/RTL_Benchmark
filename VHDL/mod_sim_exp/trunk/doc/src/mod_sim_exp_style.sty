%		This syntax file is intended for students of the				%
%		KaHo St. Lieven writing their master thesis.					%
%		We hope they can use it as a helping hand in writing			%
%		their thesis. 													%
%																		%
%		This package will take care of the formatting of the 			%
%		document. When all student used this syntax (or 				%
%		another), we can come to an universal thesis format				%
%		which adds to the professionalism of our university				%
%		documents														%
