To simulate the design, use make in this directory. The needed simulation 
programs are Modelsim(vsim,vcom,vlog)

The supported make targets are: (default is mod_sim_exp)

- clean: removes previous compiled directories and library and simulation files

- mod_sim_exp_lib: creates the mod_sim_exp library

- work_lib: creates the work library

- libs: creates the 2 previous libraries

- mod_sim_exp_com: compiles only the modular simultaneous exponentiation core, not
		   the interfaces or testbenches.

- mod_sim_exp_tb: compiles only the testbenches

- msec_if: compiles the axi interface

- mod_sim_exp: compiles the mod sim exp core en runs the testbench

- mod_sim_exp_axi: compiles the mod sim exp core and AXI interface. Runs the
		   testbench for design with axi interface.
