6. Executing dhrystone benchmark

Dhrystone Benchmark, Version 2.1 (Language: C)

Program compiled without 'register' attribute

Execution starts, 1 runs through Dhrystone
Execution ends

Final values of the variables used in the benchmark:

        should be:   B
Arr_1_Glob[8]:       7
        should be:   7
Arr_2_Glob[8][7]:    11
        should be:   Number_Of_Runs + 10
