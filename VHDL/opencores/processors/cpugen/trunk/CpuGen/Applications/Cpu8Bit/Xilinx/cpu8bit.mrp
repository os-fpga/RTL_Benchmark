NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:175 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFG symbol
   "NRESET_BUFGP/BUFG" (output signal=NRESET_BUFGP) has a mix of clock and
   non-clock loads. Some of the non-clock loads are (maximum of 5 listed):
   Pin CLR of XLXI_3_out_1reg_3
   Pin CLR of XLXI_1_I5_daddr_c_6
   Pin CLR of XLXI_1_I5_daddr_c_7
   Pin PRE of XLXI_1_I5_ndwe_c
   Pin CLR of XLXI_1_I5_daddr_c_8

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:95 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
