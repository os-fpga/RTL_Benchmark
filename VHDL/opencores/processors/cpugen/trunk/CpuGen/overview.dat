Description:

Cpugen (TM) generates customizable RISC cpu cores. 
For every generated cpu core, it permits to define: 
address/data/instruction bus size, interrupt, indirect addressing, 
data/instruction variable latency, custom instructions support.  
Targeted to low size FPGAs. Easy use and getting started with.
GNU VHDL source code provided

Features 

1) Portability:

vendor dependent blocks (ex. memory blocks) are kept separate from vendor 
independent logic. Customizable built-in assembler with data/instruction 
memory files generation; output file formats for the following environments:
	
	- Altera
	- Xilinx
	- binary
	- testbench

2) Configurability: 

In order to optimize logic resources and take advantage of FPGA flexibility; 
targeted to low size FPGAs; it permits to define: 

	- address/data/instruction bus size 
	- stack type/depth 
	- interrupt 
	- indirect address 
	- data/instruction variable latency
	- custom instructions support
	
3) Graphical user interface:


4) Easy to use and getting started with: 

	- Tutorial and example files are supplied with the package
	- Xilinx/Altera 4/8/16/32 bit cpu applications samples
	- GNU VHDL source code


Development Status :

- Current release 2.0
- VHDL simulations 
- Tested on Altera and Xilinx evaluation boards 
- Test/debug currently in progress
