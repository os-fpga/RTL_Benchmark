This folder has the test-bench for AES decryption IP  and ModelSim script file to run the simulation.

Simulation Option 1(Using this scripts):
Launch ModelSim from the same folder where simulate.do is saved and run this script in ModelSim terminal.
Modelsim> do simulate.do

Simulation Option 2:
Open ModelSim GUI and add source code interactively and run simulation. 


Note :  There are few more test bench VHDL files to test individual components of this IP.Please check misc_tb folder
