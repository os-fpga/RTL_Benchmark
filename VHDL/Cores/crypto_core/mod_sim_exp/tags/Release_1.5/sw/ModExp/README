This program generates test values for the testbench, the values generated are 
for executing simultaneous exponentiations.

To use the program pass the output of the program to a file:
ModExp.exe > output.txt

and then give in numbers in pairs, first give in de base width (in bits), then
give in the exponent width (in bits). The generation of values is stopped when
0 is inputted as a parameter.
