This program generates test values for the testbench, the values generated are 
for executing modular multiplications.

To use the program pass the output of the program to a file:
ModMult.exe > output.txt

and then give in de base width (in bits) for each set of needed values. The 
generation of values is stopped when 0 is inputted as a parameter.
