1. Introduction
---------------
  This project is a hardware implementation of the Crypto-PAn technique for
  cryptography based prefix preserving anonymization of IP addresses, described in
  [1]. A highly pipelined implementation of the AES cipher (Rijndael) [2] is used
  as the underlying pseudorandom function.

  For every bit of the input IP address, a 128-bit AES block encrypt is
  required. To be capable of high line rates, a fully pipelined AES engine
  capable of 32Gbit/s throughput on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA was implemented.

  The AES engine has a few options for the implementation of the S-boxes, which
  affects area and timing performance. It is possible to use a logic
  implementation by setting the 'use_bram' constant in 'cryptopan_package' to
  'false' and 'syn_romstyle' attribute in 'sbox' to 'logic'. If 'syn_romstyle'
  isn't set then block rams may be inferred. Alternatively, if
  block rams are present, as in the Xilinx Virtex FPGA's, eight dual port
  18Kbit B-RAMs may be used as ROM's by setting 'use_bram' to 'true'.  

2. Simulation/Synthesis results
-------------------------------
  This core has been simulated using Aldec Riviera 200602, using a compiled
  version of the XilinxCoreLib from Xilinx ISE 8.2. 

  Synthesis for the Virtex-4 FX60 FPGA was carried out using Synplicity Synplify
  Pro, and Xilinx ISE 8.2 for map, floorplanning, and place & route. To meet
  timing at 250MHz floorplanning constraints were required. The constraints
  used for the FX60 part are included in the synth directory as an example.
