The Quadrature Oscillator generates fixed frequency complex harmonic signals with minimal hardware consumption.

The Quadrature Oscillator is given as one module in the VHDL package file "dds_sine_pack.vhd"
Because there is a very long sinewave lookup table inside the "dds_sine_pack.vhd" file, the entity
for the Quadrature Oscillator starts around line 20000.
