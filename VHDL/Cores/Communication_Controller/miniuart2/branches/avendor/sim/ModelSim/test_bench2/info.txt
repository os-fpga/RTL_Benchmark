This testbench will make the UART emit a char 0x50 en TxD line.

at 200nS, the byte is written in the wb_dat_i vector.
at 4.43uS, the inttx_o signal goes low to indicate the transmiter is busy.
at 26.1uS, the inttx_o signal goes high. This rising edge indicates that the transmiter is
   ready to accept an incoming byte.
at 210uS, the char has been emited. The status reg is read (at adr 1). Its value 01 indicates
   that the transmiter is not busy (Bit0 = 1).
The baudrate is 57600bps.
