This directore contains files, which are used for implementation
of four channel FADE version in the AFCK board:
http://www.ohwr.org/projects/afck
with four SFP+ transceivers put into FMC board with 4 SFP+ cages.

Please note, that the test data sources are hidden in the
fade_one_channel blocks. 
Probably you need to remove the data generator process from these
blocks, and add necessary ports in the fade_one_channel blocks,
to feed them with your data.
