This is a seriously reworked version of the FADE protocol, developed especially
for operation with "jumbo packets" with 8192 bytes of user data.
It is intented for use with FPGA boards equipped with 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s Ethernet
links.
Protocol has been tested with KC705 board (10Gb/s) and Atlys board (1Gb/s).
Comparing to the original version, the following changes have been introduced:
1. Frames with 8192 bytes of user data are used (instead of 1024 bytes)
2. Frames contain also the protocol version identifier
3. Packet management is seriously changes. Concept of "sets" is dropped.
   Instead each data packet has its number (modulo 2^32) in the data stream.
   This allowed to significantly reduce amount of operations needed to handle
   incoming packet in the driver. It was necessary for 10Gb/s operation.
4. It is possible now to send user commands from PC to the FPGA board.
   Each command has 16-bit command code (must be above 0x100) and 32-bit argument.
   The FPGA board returns 12-byte response for each command (first 4 bytes
   however should contain the command code and is sequential number, 8 bytes
   may be defined by the user).
