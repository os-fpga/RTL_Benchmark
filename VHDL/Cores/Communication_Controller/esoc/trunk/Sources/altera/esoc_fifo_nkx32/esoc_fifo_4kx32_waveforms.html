<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file esoc_fifo_4kx32.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design esoc_fifo_4kx32.vhd.  The design esoc_fifo_4kx32.vhd has a depth of 4096 words of 32 bits each. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
