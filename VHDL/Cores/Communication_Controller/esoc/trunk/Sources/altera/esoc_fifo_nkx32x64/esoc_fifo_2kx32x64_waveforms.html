<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file esoc_fifo_2kx32x64.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo_mixed_widths megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design esoc_fifo_2kx32x64.vhd.  The design esoc_fifo_2kx32x64.vhd has a write-side depth of 2048 words of 32 bits each. a read-side width of 64. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
