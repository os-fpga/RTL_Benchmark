Use the build script (build.sh) to compile the simple test program (testcase1.cpp).
In this test case we send an array of 10 floats, after which the program waits 
for a reply consisting of 10 float from the FPGA. The software interface depends
on a working installation of the boost libraries (www.boost.org) and a resonable
c++ compiler and STL implementation.

The example also serves as the official documentation for the software interface,
as far as the initilization of the fpga_con_t and fpga_bgr_t objects is concerned.

of this library.
