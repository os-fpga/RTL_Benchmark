Test Bench

If you want to run the test bench, then go to the bench subdirectory and
then run the modelsim do file, i.e. `modelsim_bench.do'. This simulation
will generate an output into a file called `ecb_tbl_result_enc.txt' and
`ecb_tbl_result_dec.txt', then you can analyze those file to see the
result.
