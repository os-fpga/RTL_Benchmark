# Ignored Warnings:
#       (CMD-018)  Warning: duplicate option %s overrides previous value.
#       (UCN-4)    Warning: The specified replacement character (%c) is conflicting with the specified allowed or restricted character.
#       (ELAB-304) Warning: Case or if statement, or ?: operator has an infer_mux attribute and a default branch or incomplete mapping. This might cause nonoptimal logic if a MUX is inferred.
# 	(ELAB-311) Warning: DEFAULT branch of CASE statement cannot be reached.
# 	(ELAB-335) Warning: 'Case' statement is full and has only one nontrivial branch; it will be inlined. 
# 	(ELAB-338) Warning: %s Module %s contains a supply%d variable %s. Replacing with wire driven by a continuous assignment to %d
# 	(VER-61)   Warning: %s Statement unreachable %s.
# 	           - this should be verified by coverage test
# 	           - some is unreachable because the input of generated code block has constant input (reviewed)
#	(VER-130)  Warning: %s: Intraassignment delays for nonblocking assignments are ignored. 
#	(VER-173)  Warning: %s: delays for continuous assignment are ignored. 
#	(VER-314)  Warning: %s Starting with the 2000.11-1 release, the Presto Verilog reader treats Verilog integer types as signed; synthesized result may not match earlier versions of HDL Compiler.
#	(VER-318)  Warning: %s %s to %s %s occurs. 
#	(VER-921)  Warning: %s The macro %s you are attempting to undefine with the `undef directive is not defined.
#	(VO-4)     Warning: Verilog assign or tran statements are written out.
#	(VO-11)    Warning: Verilog writer has added %d nets to module %s using %s as prefix. Please use the change_names command to make the correct changes before invoking the verilog writer.
#       (LINT-63)  Warning: Net %s has a single tri-state driver.
#       (TIM-134)  Warning: Design %s contains %d high-fanout nets. A fanout number of %d will be used for delay calculations involving these nets.
#       (TIM-164)  Warning: The trip points for the library named %s differ from those in the library named %s.
#	(TIM-250)  Warning: At pin %s clock %s does not have the needed 'rise' edge.
#       (UID-101)  Warning: Attribute %s does not exist on %s %s.
#       (UID-60)   Warning: Ignoring compile_fix_multiple_port_nets = %s.
#                  Warning: Filename too long >255 chars. Renaming file: %s.
#	(UISN-40)  Warning: DesignWare synthetic library dw_foundation.sldb is added to the synthetic_library in the current command.
#	(OPT-1342) Warning: The -timing_high_effort_script option is ignored.
