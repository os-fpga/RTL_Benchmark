# Design Description

The simple Serial Peripheral Interface core is an enhanced version of the Serial Peripheral Interface found on Motorola's M68HC11 family of CPUs. The Serial Peripheral Interface is a serial, synchronous communication protocol that requires a minimum of 3 wires. Enhancements to the original interface include a wider supported operating frequency range, 4 entries deep read and write FIFOs, and programmable transfer count dependent interrupt generation. The high compatibility with the M68HC11 SPI port ensures that existing software can use this core without major modifications. New software can use existing examples as a starting point.

## Features
