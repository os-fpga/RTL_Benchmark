# Design Description

Simple General Purpose IO port. It supports up to 8 GPIO pins. Each pin is individually programmable as either input or output. The core features an 8bit wishbone interface. Wider wishbone interfaces are easily supported by using multiple instances (e.g. 4 simple GPIO cores provide a 32bit wishbone interface).

## Features

- Up to 8 GPIO pins per core
- Each GPIO pin individually programmable as either input or output
- Static synchronous design
- Fully synthesisable

# Utilization Report
